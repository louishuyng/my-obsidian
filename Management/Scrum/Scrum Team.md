## The Scrum Team Size
![[Pasted image 20230720170432.png]]
- The optimal Scrum Team Size is small enough to remain flexible and large enough to complete significant work in the Sprint
- Not bigger than 10 (1 product owner, 1 scrum master, 8 developers). Notes: It is just a recommendation, not a rule!

### How is the Product Backlog ordered?
Ordering based on 
- Value of the work
- Size of the work
- Dependencies between the items
Not by who is available during the sprint
Not by external products or vendors
