## Overview
![[Pasted image 20230718135220.png]]
## Organization Goals
- Product Vision (Not required in scrum)
- Product Goal
	- Long term objective
	- only 1 product goal at a time
- Sprint Goal
	- Objective for the current sprint

All should be 
- created with transparency
- allow inspection (able to check product development is on track)
- Adaptation (allow change the course if needed)

## Product Backlog
```
Product -> Benefit -> Value (Value is a scrum term)
```

### What is backlog?
Accumulation of unfinished work (can see as to-do list). More important, it needs to be in order

Items in product backlog refer to **Product Backlog Item (PBI)**
- Description
- order
- size
- value
- acceptance criteria

The **product owner** is accountable for the product backlog (**Product Backlog Management**)
- Objective that the product should achieve (**Product Goal** that is a commitment for product backlog). Need to collaborate with stakeholders

### Requirements
The backlog needs to be
- **Transparency** (Each item in the backlog should be clear and not ambiguous)
- Have been **Inspection** (Observing conditions)
- **Adaptation** (need to change when something is wrong, missing, or unclear)

The backlog needs to be continuously improved it call **Refinement**
- by clarifying details, answering questions, or adding things that need to be done
- collaborate with developers to break down large items are broken down to smaller ones

## User Stories
Short description of a feature explained from the perspective of the person who desires the functionality (usually a user of the product)

**Notes:**  User stories are not mandatory in SCRUM

### 3C's
3 Steps to process
- Card
> The card refers to the paper card size used to write the user story, usually a post it or similar in size.
- Conversation
 ```
 As a <Some User> # Who
 I want <Some Objective> # What
 So that <Some Outcome> # Why
 ```
- Confirmation -> Acceptance Criteria

## Estimate (Sizing in Scrum)

Is a guess of the effort necessary to carry out a given task

## Sprint Backlog
![[Pasted image 20230718154755.png]]
Plan = Decomposition of each PBI in smaller work units (tasks)

###  Sprint Scope vs Sprint Goal
![[Pasted image 20230718160234.png]]

- Sprint Scope: Functionality developed during the sprint
- Scope of the Sprint Backlog: Amount of work selected by the developer -> Selected Product Items
The Scope is flexible and can be  during the Sprint

> Scope == Sprint Scope == Scope of the Sprint Backlog

Notes: Scope can be renegotiation with the product owner from the developer

Idea: meets the Sprint Goal while making some compromises, usually in terms of features ,never on quality

## Increment & Definition of Done

### Increment
- The **increment** is a new version of the product. And It's additive to all previous Increments from all previous Sprint
- needs to be usable without needing any additional work

### Definition of Done (Commitment for the Increment)
- Need to answer the question `What is Done mean?` -> Definition of Don
- Quality standards of the organization need to be followed at a minimum
- Transparency for the product increment
- Guide developers on how many product backlog items to choose during Sprint Planning Meeting

In each sprint, at least one new Product Increment needs to adhere to the Definition of Done.
If a Product Backlog Item in the Sprint does not follow the Definition of Done => it will not be included in the Product Increment

### Definition of Done vs Acceptance Criteria

| Definition of Done |  Acceptance criteria |
| - | - |
| Applies to every PBI & the Increment | Applies to a single PBI |
| Created by the Scrum Team | Created by the Product Owner |
| Commitment of the Increment |  Part of a PBI |
| Mandatory in Scrum | Optional in Scrum |

For releasing one PBI to the users, it need to meet the Acceptance criteria, if they were defined, and the Definition of Done

The Increment created for one or more PBIs also needs to meet the Definition of Done

## Epic

That is not mentioned in Scrum Guide
- A Large amount of work that does not fit in a Sprint. For example Epic Redesign the whole UI 
- We can Break it down into multiple user stories
