## Time-Box
- Maximum duration of events
- 8 hours for a one-month Sprint
- Force you to focus on the main important thing
- Are useful for making any issues visible

Time-Boxes apply to All Scrum Events, Apart from the Sprint itself

## Sprint Duration
- Duration of the Sprint higher than 1 month can increase complexity and risk (shot horizons are easier to plan)
- Depending on various factors, the scrum team collaborates with stakeholders in an  organization to decide the duration of the sprint
- It is not connected to the release of the Product
