1. In your CloudFront distribution, specify one or more trusted key groups containing the public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the URL signature. You use the corresponding private keys to sign the URLs.
    
    For more information, seeÂ [Specifying the signers that can create signed URLs and signed cookies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html).
    
2. Develop your application to determine whether a user should have access to your content and to create signed URLs for the files or parts of your application that you want to restrict access to. For more information, see the following topics:
    
    - [Creating a signed URL using a canned policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-canned-policy.html)
        
    - [Creating a signed URL using a custom policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html)
        
    
3. A user requests a file for which you want to require signed URLs.
    
4. Your application verifies that the user is entitled to access the file: they've signed in, they've paid for access to the content, or they've met some other requirement for access.
    
5. Your application creates and returns a signed URL to the user.
    
6. The signed URL allows the user to download or stream the content.
    
    This step is automatic; the user usually doesn't have to do anything additional to access the content. For example, if a user is accessing your content in a web browser, your application returns the signed URL to the browser. The browser immediately uses the signed URL to access the file in the CloudFront edge cache without any intervention from the user.
    
7. CloudFront uses the public key to validate the signature and confirm that the URL hasn't been tampered with. If the signature is invalid, the request is rejected.
    
    If the signature is valid, CloudFront looks at the policy statement in the URL (or constructs one if you're using a canned policy) to confirm that the request is still valid. For example, if you specified a beginning and ending date and time for the URL, CloudFront confirms that the user is trying to access your content during the time period that you want to allow access.
    
    If the request meets the requirements in the policy statement, CloudFront does the standard operations: determines whether the file is already in the edge cache, forwards the request to the origin if necessary, and returns the file to the user.
