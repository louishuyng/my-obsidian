IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) and throughput are key metrics used to measure performance for storage devices. However, IOPS and throughput are fundamentally different, and measure different aspects of performance. As modern businesses continue to adopt more digital technologies and rely on non-hardware storage technologies such as cloud and virtualization for their data, understanding the difference between IOPS and throughput is becoming increasingly important to build your ideal storage environment.

## **What Is IOPS?**

As the name implies, IOPS measures the number of input and output (i.e. read and write) operations that can be performed on a storage device within a single second. IOPS is a standard performance benchmark for any storage device, including hard drives (both HDD and SSD), flash drives, and network attached storage (NAS) devices as part of a storage area network (SAN). While IOPS itself doesn't indicate the amount of data that the drive can process, it is nevertheless a critical metric for storage devices because it directly frames the device’s ability to handle requests from applications and users.

Typically, a higher IOPS number indicates better storage performance and faster response times, but measuring the exact IOPS can be tricky because there are so many factors that determine performance. For example, the type of drive is an important factor, as SSD will have different performance calculations compared to HDD, even if they are the same size.  In addition, IOPS can differ depending on whether the data is accessed sequentially or randomly, and IOPS can also be different for read and write operations - for example, HDDs generally will have higher IOPS for sequential data writes.

The performance of data-intensive applications, such as databases, ERP systems, and virtual machines, is directly affected by the number of input/output operations that a storage system can execute. Therefore, higher IOPS can be a good indicator that a storage system will meet your requirements.

## **What Is Throughput?**

Throughput, on the other hand, is a measure of how much data can be transferred in a given amount of time, usually measured in bytes per second. Throughput takes into account the size of the data being transferred, as well as the time it takes to transfer that data. Throughput is helpful in estimating requirements of data-intensive applications (especially multimedia and big data), as well as planning bandwidth.

In terms of performance, higher throughput generally indicates better network performance and faster data transfer times. In contrast to IOPS, throughput provides a concrete assessment of storage performance, because it tells you how much data can be processed. You can use this metric to conclude whether a given storage device meets your IT environment requirements.
