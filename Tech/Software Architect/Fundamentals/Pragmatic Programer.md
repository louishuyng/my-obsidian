## ETC
A thing is well designed if it adapts to the people who use it. For code, that means it must adapt by changing. So we believe in the ETC principle: Easier to Change. ETC. That's it.

As far as we can tell, every design principle out there is a special case of ETC.

Why is decoupling good? Because by isolating concerns we make each easier to change. ETC.

Why is the single responsibility principle useful? Because a change in requirements is mirrored by a change in just one module. ETC.

Why is naming important? Because good names make code easier to read, and you have to read it to change it. ETC!

## DRY
The alternative is to have the same thing expressed in two or more places. If you change one, you have to remember to change the others, or, like the alien computers, your program will be brought to its knees by a contradiction. It isn't a question of whether you'll remember: it's a question of when you'll forget.

## Orthogonality
In computing, the term has come to signify a kind of independence or decoupling. Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others. In a well-designed system, the database code will be orthogonal to the user interface: you can change the interface without affecting the database, and swap databases without changing the interface.

## Reversibility
What you can do is make it easy to change. Hide third-party APIs behind your own abstraction layers. Break your code into components: even if you end up deploying them on a single massive server, this approach is a lot easier than taking a monolithic application and splitting it. (We have the scars to prove it.)

No one knows what the future may hold, especially not us! So enable your code to rock-n-roll: to â€œrock on'' when it can, to roll with the punches when it must.

## Tracer Bullets
That same principle applies to projects, particularly when you're building something that hasn't been built before. We use the term tracer bullet development to visually illustrate the need for immediate feedback under actual conditions with a moving goal.
- Users get to see something working early
- Developers build a structure to work in
- You have an integration platform
- You have something to demonstrate
- You have a better feel for progress
> Tracer bullets show what you're hitting. This may not always be the target. You then adjust your aim until they're on target. That's the point.
